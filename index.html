					<p>I am a Web Developer/Moviegoer and Board Sports enthusiast living in New York City. I'm proficient in a wide range of development and design technologies: Javascript, Angular, Node, Express, Mongoose, React, Html, Css and experienced with others: Photoshop, Final cut, Premiere, Illustrator... Always looking for the next thrilling experience.</p>
					<p>After discovering a passion for Javascript software development I joined Fullstack Academy. Now I spent most of my time learning new and old technologies while working part-time as a fashion photographer. In my free time I build web applications, watch movies, surf and skate.</p>
					<p>Prior to becoming a Software Engineer I spent years in the filmmaking industry. Many of the films I shot or directed were accepted into world renowned film festivals, and a few even won awards. The last one titled "The First Anniversary" was accepted and screened at Cannes Film Festival. I also dedicated a lot of my time to writing: one of the screenplays I wrote was shortlisted to be published by an Italian publishing house. Three years ago I obtained an O1 visa, "person with extraordinary ability" and recently, after applying for a green card, I received a working authorization permit that allows me to be employed by any company.</p>
